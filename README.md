## Projects

### Simulink Variant Reducer

#### Duration

Jun 2019 – Present

#### Description

Simulink provides Variant Blocks which are used to create multiple variations of a model. Based on the configuration a particular variation will be activated. Variant Reducer used to reduce variations depending on user provided options. Variant Reducer is used to create a simpler model with minimum or no variations.

#### Roles/Responsibility

- Requirements analysis from customer
- Software Design and Development
- Implementation using C++, MATLAB

### ADAS using Front Facing Camera

#### Duration

Nov 2018 – Jun 2019

#### Description

ADAS (Advanced Driver Assistance Systems) using Front Facing Camera Project aims at providing various Active Safety features like Automatic Emergency Breaking, Lane Departure Warning etc. using Monocular Camera as a primary sensor.

#### Roles/Responsibility

- Implementation of Camera Pipeline for Perception Algorithm
- Implementation of CAN Pipeline for Automatic Emergency Breaking (AEB)
- Development of various modules using Texas Instruments Vision SDK on TDA2Px hardware
- Implementation using C, C++, Python

### Multi Agent Cloud SLAM

#### Duration

Jul 2017 – Oct 2018

#### Description

SLAM (Simultaneous Localization and Mapping) constructs/updates a map of an unknown environment while simultaneously keeping track of an agent's location within it.
MACS (Multi Agent Cloud SLAM) collects map and location information from multiple cars(agents) and builds a global HD map in the cloud. This global HD map be used by cars(agents) for better positioning.

#### Roles/Responsibility

- Fusing GPS information in Monocular Visual SLAM
- Augment semantic information into Visual SLAM pipeline
- Implementation using C++, Python

### Navigation Middleware

#### Duration

Jul 2014 - Jun 2017

#### Description

The Project aimed at providing data from Core-Navigation, like Positioning information to other modules in the system like Diagnostics module, HMI, CarPlay and Android Auto using DBus and QNX Resource Manager.
The Project also aimed at providing information to Core-Navigation from external source, like SiriusXM traffic data, weather data from platform SXM application. It also bridges Speech data communication from HARMAN Core Navigation to Nuance Speech Engine for Navigation voice guidance.

#### Roles/Responsibilities

- Software Development for Bike Navigation Middleware for [Yamaha](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prOmkAIrVHE&ab_channel=YamahaMotorUSA) and [Honda](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kntl1u3eGBQ&ab_channel=HondaMotorcyclesCanada) products
